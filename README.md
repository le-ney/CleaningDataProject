Cleaning Data Peer Assement Project
===================

###Instructions to run the script

  1. Please download the raw data from this [link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip ) then unzip and save the folder in your local machine.
  2. Download run_Analysis.R file to your local machine and load the script into R studio or Rgui.
  3. Load data.table library using library(data.table) command.
  4. Run the script by run_Analysis (directory) command where directory is the path to the raw data on your local machine. Please note, enter the directory path using forward slash (/), as it is on Linux and Mac systems.
  5. The script generates "tidy_set.txt" file containing a data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This file is located in the same folder of your raw data. This might take approximately 10-15 second depending on the power of your machine.
